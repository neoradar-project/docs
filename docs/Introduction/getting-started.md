# Getting Started

Welcome to **NeoRadar Client**!

## Testing Information

NeoRadar Client is currently in alpha testing phase. This early release allows us to gather valuable feedback from users while we continue to develop and refine the software.

### What to Expect During Testing

- **Bugs and Issues**: As with any alpha software, you should expect to encounter bugs, glitches, and unexpected behavior. These are normal during this phase of development.
- **Frequent Updates**: We'll be releasing updates regularly to fix issues and implement improvements based on your feedback.
- **Incomplete Features**: Some features may be partially implemented or temporarily unavailable.
- **Performance Variability**: Performance may vary across different systems and network conditions.

### Reporting Issues

Your feedback is crucial to improving NeoRadar Client. We will shortly be opening up our issue tracking platform. In the meantime, please note any issues you encounter for future reporting, otherwise refer to your invitee for more information.

When reporting bugs, please use our [Bug Report Template](./introduction/bug-report) to provide all necessary information, including your client version, what you were doing, expected vs. actual results, and relevant log files with timestamps.
